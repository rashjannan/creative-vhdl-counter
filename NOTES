# Project Notes – Creative VHDL Counter

This file is my personal build log for the project. I’ll use it to track my daily progress, challenges, and what I learn along the way.  

---

## Day 0 – Project Setup
- Created GitHub repository **creative-vhdl-counter**  
- Added initial 'README.md' with project scope and repo structure  
- Planned out modules:  
  - JK Flip-Flop (baseline building block)  
  - 3-bit Counter (core project)  
  - Creative features (pause/resume, up/down counting)  
- Set up folder structure: 'src/', 'tb/', 'waveforms/', 'docs/' 

Ready to start coding the JK Flip-Flop next.
