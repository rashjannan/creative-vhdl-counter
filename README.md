# Creative VHDL Counter

This project implements a 3-bit counter in VHDL, inspired by my McGill ECSE 222 Digital Logic course, but expanded with creative features.

## Features
- DFF (building block)
- 3-bit counter with reset and enable
- Expanded features:
  - Pause/Resume
  - Up/Down counting
  - Modulo-N version

## Tools
- Intel Quartus Prime
- ModelSim (for simulation)

## Repo Structure
- **src/** --> VHDL source files  
- **tb/** --> Testbenches  
- **waveforms/** --> Simulation outputs (screenshots)  
- **docs/** → Notes and logs  

## Progress
I’m documenting each step of development in [`docs/NOTES.md`](docs/NOTES.md).
